# Trellis Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

This project is managed by Trellis. The working knowledge you need lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/workflow.md` — development phases, when to create tasks, skill routing
- `.trellis/spec/` — package- and layer-scoped coding guidelines (read before writing code in a given layer)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals and session traces
- `.trellis/tasks/` — active and archived tasks (PRDs, research, jsonl context)

If a Trellis command is available on your platform (e.g. `/trellis:finish-work`, `/trellis:continue`), prefer it over manual steps. Not every platform exposes every command.

If you're using Codex or another agent-capable tool, additional project-scoped helpers may live in:
- `.agents/skills/` — reusable Trellis skills
- `.codex/agents/` — optional custom subagents

Managed by Trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved; edits inside may be overwritten by a future `trellis update`.

## Trellis spec mechanism (mandatory when rotating between models)

- **A work order must embed the original text of two specs**: the nearest `AGENTS.md` for the target package + the relevant `.trellis/spec/` index.
- **Specs must be machine-checkable** (attach the grep command, run it before delivery and again at review time); relying on discipline alone always drifts.
- **Formatting fixes belong to the reviewer-of-record, not the auditor** — letting the auditing role edit code destroys independence.
- **Do not skip Phase 3.3 `trellis-update-spec`** (required): this batch's specs are written back so the next batch inherits them automatically.
- Deep usage (skills list / spec mechanism / migration criteria / review blind spots) → `/home/chris/orca/projects/trellis/shared/rules/trellis-handbook-omp.md`, **do not `@`-preload it**. Three moments where it must be read: ① before entering the planning phase of a new trellis task ② before handing work to another model ③ before closing out a batch.
- **Formal pause (mandatory)**: stopping mid-way through a trellis task **must use `/trellis:paused-work`** (commit + RESUME anchor + no archiving).
